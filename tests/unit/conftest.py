"""Unit-test fixtures: an in-memory connection fake that mirrors the real API.

FakeConnection stands in for ConnectionHandler for the bulk of Tab/WebElement
methods that merely translate a Python call into a CDP command and return
simple state. It exposes only the real ConnectionHandler surface plus
configuration/inspection helpers; it deliberately cannot inject events. Event
driven flows (callbacks, go_to, dialogs populated by events) are covered against
the real handler and FakeCDPServer in the integration suite instead.
